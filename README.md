# Assorted Microcontroller Sketches

## CardKB Text Buffer
Modified version of the M5Stack CardKB text buffer library refactored into a single page sketch that works with the adafruit 1306 OLED screen library. The adafruit library does not return the cursor postion so an average character size in pixels was used.

## Clock
Arduino Uno based alarm clock.

## Charlieplexed Larson Scanner
Code from one of my earliest electronics projects.

## LED Matrix
Code for the strange LED Matricies I bought long ago.

## ESP 8266 WiFI Scanner
Simple ESP8266 project to scan for nearby WiFi networks.
